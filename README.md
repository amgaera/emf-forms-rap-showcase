======================

### Showcase

##### Controls
* input field with text
* input field with integer
* date picker
* time picker
* combo box
* checkbox
* tables

##### Layouts
* horizontal layout 
* vertical layout 
* groups
* grouped grid
* hierarchical forms
* tree master detail views

Vertical and Horizontal Layouts are very simple, but powerful, container elements. Both can contain any other type of view model element, e.g., a control or another container. 

This element allows you to group an arbitrary number of other elements, controls or containers.

##### Rules
* visibility
* enablement

##### Custom elements
* custom area (e.g. google map widget)
ECP provides standard controls for every type of attribute or reference. Additionally, it is possible to replace these default controls with your own implementations. 

##### Overal example
Should show all elements
